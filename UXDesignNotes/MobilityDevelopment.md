Moblie Web apps are apps that hosted entirely on the web. Meaning the client does not need to
download an application on their phone to use the app. As the entire app lives on the web, the
updates could be redistributed to the target audience instantly.

Moblie web apps are developed by HTML5 JQM. They are poor in look and feel and do not have the
features a mobile has

The body tag consists of a form tag to accept the users name and print the result
Some of the challenges faced in this approach are:
 Low performance due to browser dependency.
 Limited access to hardware features of the device.
 No offline support.
Native approach meaning you download the app. Traditional approach where the apps are designed
for a single platform. Runs in binary. Meaning it has to relate directly to the device you are
programming for. Each device has a different language
 Android
o Language: Java or Kotlin
o Framework: JDK, Android SDK
o Tools: Android Studio 
 iOS
o Language: Objective C or Swift
o Framework: iOS SDK 
o Tools: XCode 

 Windows Phone
o Language: C#
o Framework: Windows Phone SDK
o Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio
Some of the challenges faced in this approach are:
 Multiple code base for different mobile platforms.
 Need for multi-skilled resources.
 Higher investment in terms of effort and management.
 Expensive to build and maintain.

 Accessing the device storage and device specific look and feel are provided only by using
native specific technologies

Hybrid mobile application development approach is appropriate for the LMA application.
1. All the UI design and functionality can be implemented using web UI frameworks.
2. The code can then be wrapped using PhoneGap for various platforms, thereby providing high code
portability and also wider coverage for the client. Similar result can be achieved using C# and
Xamarin. 
Deciding upon the right mobile app development approach depends upon a number of factors. Let&#39;s
now look at the parameters to be considered for deciding the appropriate approach.

 Compatibility
o The foremost challenge in mobile application development is designing the User
Interface for the mobile application. Mobile devices have varied screen sizes with
different display resolutions. The developer must ensure that application&#39;s UI fits
into all the devices.
o The diverse mobile devices available in the market provide a huge challenge to the
developer. Since the mobile devices have various OS/platforms and highly varying
device hardware specifications, developers should find the right techniques to
support most of the devices.

 Diversity

o Mobile operating systems gets updated very frequently. So the mobile application
must be backward compatible.
o Though ~83% of users belong to the major mobile OS/platform (Android, iOS,
Windows Phone), there are smart devices which run on platforms like Tizen, FireOS,
LGWebOS and many other operating systems. Creating apps that run on all these
platforms becomes a challenge.

 Performance
o Eliminating the common performance issues like high battery usage, internet data
and managing memory space in the mobile devices are common challenges for the
developer.
 Security
o Mobile Application Security is a major area of concern as the users&#39; privacy is at
stake. The data which is stored offline in the users&#39; device are prone to attacks by
malicious applications. The developer must ensure that the data is secure.
