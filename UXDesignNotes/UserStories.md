# Overview

How a customer or user will use your application. they will interview customers and see what kinds of projects they are facing, from there they create a user story.

This is how the user stories are written
AS A <USER ROLE>
I WANT TO <WHAT>
SO THAT I CAN <WHY>

from a user perspective, i.e. a pet owner, want pet to have a profile page
AS A PET OWNER
I WANT TO HAVE A PROFILE PAGE FOR MY PET
SO THAT OTHER PET OWNERS CAN SEE MY PET BEFORE THAT INITIAL MEETUP

AS A PET OWNER
I WANT TO HVE A PROFILE PAGE FOR MY PET 
SO THAT I CAN SHARE STORIES ABOUT MY PET WITH OTHER PET OWNERS

opportunity to have a conversation with the target audience, to figure out what they like, what theyre problems are. to figure out why they will enjoy using it and to build your application around that. so that it can solve their problems

teh last part of the user story, the **"SO THAT"** that part should be testable. so you can have test subjects later on. you can iterate through the why. make sure that when you are working through it, you can deliver on those user stories

Development will be driven by user stories that represent our understanding of user needs

# EPICS AND PERSONAS
epics are like user stories but they are way bigger and cannot complete them in the 2 weeks normally perscribed for a user story.
an epic is an overview of a feature without commiting to details. usually broken down into user stories
if the whole thing is a book. then the epic is a title


creating personas are fictional characters you create, based off the people who are going to be using the application. 

name, picture, characteristics, attitude, and a goal that should be solved when using your product
