# Overview

How a customer or user will use your application. they will interview customers and see what kinds of projects they are facing, from there they create a user story.

This is how the user stories are written
AS A <USER ROLE>
I WANT TO <ACTION>
SO THAT I CAN <WHY/BENEFIT>

from a user perspective, i.e. a pet owner, want pet to have a profile page
AS A PET OWNER
I WANT TO HAVE A PROFILE PAGE FOR MY PET
SO THAT OTHER PET OWNERS CAN SEE MY PET BEFORE THAT INITIAL MEETUP

AS A PET OWNER
I WANT TO HVE A PROFILE PAGE FOR MY PET 
SO THAT I CAN SHARE STORIES ABOUT MY PET WITH OTHER PET OWNERS

opportunity to have a conversation with the target audience, to figure out what they like, what theyre problems are. to figure out why they will enjoy using it and to build your application around that. so that it can solve their problems

teh last part of the user story, the **"SO THAT"** that part should be testable. so you can have test subjects later on. you can iterate through the why. make sure that when you are working through it, you can deliver on those user stories

Development will be driven by user stories that represent our understanding of user needs

User stories provide business value, where as a task has no business value
Makes sense to the end user, tasks do not make sense to the end user


Advantages of User Stories
- Prioritize design goals
- Unite the team around a clear goal
- Inspire empathetic design decisions, make things more user centered
- Personalize pitches to stake holders its not just pitching design update ideas, its demonstating how updates will help specific types of people

# PERSONAS

creating personas are fictional characters you create, based off the people who are going to be using the application. 
name, picture, characteristics, attitude, and a goal that should be solved when using your product

Benefits of making personas
- Build empathy, give stakeholders a clearer idea of who their user groups are. Numbers and statistics are easy to forget, but names and stories are more memorable and provides motivation to continue working on projects, its easier to build around a person rather than vague ideas
- Tell stories

NATALIE is 26
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER AND MARATHON RUNNER
SHE LOVES PITBULLS BUT KNOWS THEY HAVE A BAD REP
SHE WOULD LOVE TO HELP OTHERS FALL IN LOVE WITH PIT BULLS BY HAVING A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH HER PETS

ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO MANAGE ITS OWN ACCOUNT FOR THEIR PET

have to do research on the users so that it accurately represents the people who will use it

**USER GROUP is a set of people who have similar interests goals or concerns**
want to build a persona that will represent each key user group

one persona is not enough to show all user groups

## RECOGNISING BIAS IN DESIGN.

Implicit Biases: the collection attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge. "everyone who lives in sanfranscisco is environmentally friendly and buys from farmers markets." "everyone in new york walks to work" having a positive or neutral bias towards a group may skew the design. 

if your assumption is that "everyone in new york walks" then the app will give map routes for walking. but this is flawed more new yorkers may take the bus, subway, bike or drive. so it may give incorrect directions

Implicit bias is one of the many reason creating and following personas and user journey maps are so important

User journey is a path to the product. The series of experience a user has as they interact with your product

when creating personas we should be as inclusive as possible and think of all the different kinds of people who want to use it

we shouldn make assumptions on gender, age, socioeconomic group, race, ability and so on

user research help avoid assumptions being made

## TIPS
Always put yourself in the eyes of the customer while writing it. Give backstory to it

like "I want the system to be stable" is not the same as
"Because my employees work all hours, in different time zones and around the clock, I want the system to be stable"

Like what the customer gets out of the stability and why they want it 

Clarity around who the customer is, its worth it spending time on the persona

# Agile principles

Working software is the primary measure of progress
our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continous delivery of valuable software
Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential

# EPICS
epics are like user stories but they are way bigger and cannot complete them in the 2 weeks normally perscribed for a user story.
an epic is an overview of a feature without commiting to details. usually broken down into user stories
if the whole thing is a book. then the epic is a title and the stories are the chapters in the book

it is the broad strokes and the user stories specify it down

# PAIN POINTS

Any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need

- Financial
- Product
- Process things that stop the user getting from point a to point b
- Support
